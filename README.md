# DeployGRRAgent

Invoke-DeployGRRAgent.ps1 is PowerShell script to quickly deploy Google Rapid Response (GRR) agents. The goal of this project is to quickly deploy GRR agents across your network prior to or during and Incident Response.   

This is a project I started working on months ago and just now getting time to circle back around to it and git it live on GitHub. This project is a work-in-progress. I'll remove that statement and add documentation once it's complete.
